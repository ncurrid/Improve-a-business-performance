# Improve the business performance
# I. Context
As part of a consulting mission, I worked again as a Business Intelligence Analyst for Bottleneck which was seeking this time to improve its overall performance and profitability.

The company had observed stagnation in growth despite stable sales and was concerned about inefficiencies in its operations and decision-making processes. The management suspected that performance issues might stem from a lack of visibility into key business indicators and unefficient use of data in strategic planning.

My role was to analyse internal data, identify potential issues, and provide clear, actionable insights to support more effective business decisions.

# II. Methodology
To fulfill the objectives of the mission, I adopted a structured, data-driven approach composed of the following key steps:

## 1. Understanding the business context and strategic priorities
I began by conducting interviews with key stakeholders (management, sales, operations) to better understand the company’s goals, challenges, and internal processes.

## 2. Data collection and preparation
I gathered data from various sources, including sales records, operational data, and customer feedback. I ensured data quality by performing thorough cleaning, standardization, and validation checks.

## 3. Data analysis and performance diagnosis
I performed detailed analyses using KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) relevant to the company’s activities—such as customer acquisition cost, conversion rate, sales cycle duration, and product performance. This step allowed me to pinpoint underperforming areas, detect trends, and uncover hidden inefficiencies.

## 4.Recommendation of improvement strategies
Based on the analysis, I proposed data-driven strategies aimed at:

- Optimising marketing and sales efforts

- Reducing operational inefficiencies

- Improving customer satisfaction and retention

- Enhancing overall profitability

## 5. Creation of a decision-support dashboard
To ensure the sustainability of the improvements, I designed an interactive dashboard that provides real-time tracking of performance indicators, enabling managers to make informed decisions on an ongoing basis.

# III. Tools Used

Excel: For initial data exploration, cleaning, and basic analysis (pivot tables, charts).

Power BI / Tableau: For building interactive dashboards and advanced data visualizations.

SQLite: To extract and manipulate data from relational databases.

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn): For deeper data analysis and automation of repetitive tasks.

Business Model Canvas: To understand the company’s structure, value propositions, and customer segments.
